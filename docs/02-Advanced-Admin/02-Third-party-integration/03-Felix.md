# Felix Integration

This guide will help you setup the integration with **Felix**.

------------

**Version**: 5.3
**Date**: May 2025

------------
## **Introduction**

The Felix integration configuration has been tested using the following specifications:

* **API URL**: The standard Swagger specification from the Felix API is `https://<ip>/<network>`

* **API token**: Felix uses a basic authentication system providing user and password, the API token should be generated by creating the base64 encoded string from the user and password as follows base64(user:password)

* **Additional notes**: The Felix API used in the tests contains a list of accepted domain IPS. In our local environment, we make use of a proxy to bypass the request, which in production should not be needed. Just make sure that the production domain has access to the API.
