### Basic Fields

5\. The new element type window will open. From this point you must enter the data corresponding to the new element you are creating.

Click "**Name**" field and type the name. This name is used to identify the element in APX-GIS tables. The best practice is to use lower case and no spaces.

For this example, "major-cabinet-north" was typed.

6\. Click "**Type**" dropdown and select a type for the element.

**Important**: There are three general types of elements:

1. The "**Node**" element is set as an icon on the map.
2. The "**Link**" element is set as a line or series of lines, marking the points where it passes through (start and end) (no icon is needed on the map)
3. The "**Polygon**" element is set by drawing the lines that define its shape (no icon is needed on the map).

Select one of the three types to continue.

7\. Click "**Title**" field and type the tilte. This title is to display an element's reference or name that the user will see in the programme. The best practice is to use lower case and no spaces and use a similar text as the "Name" field.

 For this example, "major-cabinet-north" was typed.

**Tip:** Node element type created.


**Important:** At this point you have created the element type that can only be used in the general layer. 


To be able to use this element type in other layers, you have to assign it to the layer via the menu: **Administration > Admin Layers > "Layer" > Allowed Element Types**.


See "**Add element type to a layer**" procedure.
