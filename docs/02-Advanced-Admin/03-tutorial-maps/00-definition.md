## Map

A **map** in APX-GIS is the main view where geographic information is displayed.  
It acts as a container that brings together different sorts of data on top of a basemap, allowing users to see and understand their project in its spatial context.

Maps provide a clear and organized way to:

- Combine information from multiple sources.  
- Control how data is displayed and ordered.  
- Support project analysis and decision-making.  

In practice, the map is the **base** of APX-GIS, where projects are visualized and managed.
