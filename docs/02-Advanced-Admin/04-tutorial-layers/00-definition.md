# Layer Definition in APX-GIS

Layers in **APX-GIS** help organize element types by function or purpose. They are essential for reducing visual clutter by displaying only the necessary information on the map at any given time.

## üîç What Are Layers?

Layers are logical groupings of elements that allow users to:

- Organize the map content.
- Toggle visibility to reduce complexity.
- Focus on specific themes or components during editing or review.

## üìç How to View Available Layers

To explore the layers available within a project:

1. Hover the mouse over the **Visualization menu** icon in the top-right corner.

**Tip**: You can pin the menu on the screen by clicking the top right icon of a pin, otherwise the menu will disapear as soon as you move the mouse out of the menu.

2. Expand the **Layers** section.

## üß© Understanding Layer Contents

Once a layer is selected, it reveals the elements grouped under it. Each layer has specific **element types** assigned. More details in the [Add element type](./02-add-elemtype-layer.md) chapter.

### The Map index

Whenever more than one layer is selected, elements will be displayed on top of each other following the order of the menu. This order can be altered locally by dragging and dropping the layers in the menu.

**Note**: The new order will be tied to the Theme selected and it will only affect the user and the browser in use. To restore default order go to the three dots next to the "**layer**" tab in the **Visualization menu** and click _Reset map index_

It can also be modified globally by going to **Administration** &gt **Admin Layers** and click the button "**Edit map index**"

Within the same layer different element types can also be on top of each other. The order of those can be decided the same way with the same button "**Edit map index**" found in **Administration** &gt **Element types**

From there, for each Theme, layers and element types can be reordered as well by dragging and dropping, but this changes, will affect all users in APX.

## ‚úÖ Summary

By using layers effectively, users can streamline their APX-GIS experience and customize their workspace according to task-specific needs.
