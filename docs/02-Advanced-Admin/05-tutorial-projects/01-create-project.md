**Project Types**:

**Area**: This is the commonly used type, which allows us to consider that the elements to be mapped are located in an area with a defined shape.Â 

**Distribution Line**: allows to consider a line on which the network elements will be mapped and is normally used to trace a feeder line from one village to another.

The different types are defined by the client and can be edited via the menu "**Administration > Codifiers > Project Type**".

7\. Click "**Define**" button.
