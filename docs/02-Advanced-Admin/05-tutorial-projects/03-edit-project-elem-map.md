5\. It is good practice to select the layer before creating the element. This way when you create the element you will be able to see it immediately. If you do not select the layer at this point, you can do so later.

To select the layer, place the mouse pointer over the map option (top right side). and under Layers option look for the layer and select it. For this example "**north-distribution**" layer was selected.

8\. From this point on, the programme will ask you for data according to the element type. For this example, the "**Id**"field will remain as the programme set it up.
