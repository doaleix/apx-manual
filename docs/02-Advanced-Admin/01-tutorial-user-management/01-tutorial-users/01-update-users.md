a. **Full name**
b. **User/Mail**
c. **Roles**
d. **Operator**
e. **Login**. When a user is created, a Login is assigned to that user. 
* One user can have one or several Logins assigned. This is useful when there are several people using the same User ID, allowing to have a record of what each one does in the programme. 
* For each Login:

    * "**Can edit username/email**" is a boolean field visually represented by a tick or a cross. If editing is allowed, users can modify their full name and email. If not, the input fields will be disabled, and the Apply button will be hidden.
    * "**last login**" it is a timestamp field displaying the last time someone using that login entered APX.
    * "**last logout**" it is a timestamp field displaying the last time someone using that login exited APX.
    * "**last activity**" it is a timestamp field displaying the last time someone using that login performed a trackable action in APX.
