------------

**Version**: 5.3
**Date**: March 2025

End customers can be assigned in a Splitterbox port as by solely referencing the UPRN.

It is very similar to the process described in the previous <u>[section](02-clients.md#client-selection)</u>

Follow the same steps until you get to the "**Find client**" screen.

Then select the desired UPRN, note that you can increase the radius if the UPRN is not listed.

Make sure that the appropiate port has been updated with the selected UPRN and click the "**Apply**" button.

It is also possible to select a UPRN fromm the map by selecting the third radio button:
