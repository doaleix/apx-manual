This guide will help you understand the **Main screen**.

## **Prerequisites**
1.	**User ID** and **Password** to access APX-GIS programme.

------------

**Version**: 5.4
**Date**: September 2025

## **Main menu**


Once logged into APX-GIS, the main navigation screen will be as the following one.

![](/img/GEN-MEN-01/GEN-MEN-01-STP-01.png)

There are three main divisions and users will be able to see them depending on the set of roles and privileges each user have.

The first one is **Administration**. It is meant for Admin users and it has all the functionalities regarding managing all variables, how apx works and how it looks like. It also has all the import points to feed APX with new data.

The second one is **Network Summary**. This is where you can find all inventory lists and where you can export APX data in multiple formats.

Lastly the **Operations** menu is basically to create elements and as the name suggests it is meant for Operator users.

### **Menu customization**
To customize the menu order and the displayed titles, go to administration &gt interface options. The first screen shows an accordion for each interface group, each accordion presents all the group options in a tree structure that can be either expanded or collapsed. The options can be reordered using a drag-and-drop system with the only restriction that the parent must be preserved. Each affected option after a reorder will be visually marked to give feedback to the user. When at least one change is detected, the user can save the new list of ordered options.

Additionally, for each available option, an edit button is displayed at the end. This button opens a new form that allows to edit the displayed title in each supported language (for the moment English, Catalan and Spanish).

It is also possible to customize the visibility of each menu option for a specific user.
