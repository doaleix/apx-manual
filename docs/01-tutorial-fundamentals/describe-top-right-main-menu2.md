## Introduction

Functionality that allows the creation of arbitrary lists of elements, services and box2boxes, and highlights them on the map.
These collections can be saved with a name and description, previously saved collections can be loaded, and previously saved ones can be deleted.
When APX starts, a new element collection is instantiated, which becomes the active collection. There is always an active collection; in this way, there is no need to do anything beforehand to start adding elements, as they are always added to the active collection.

## **Step by Step**

1\. To pull down the top right menu click on the square shape at the top right of the screen.
