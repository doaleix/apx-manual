This guide will help you **Sign in** into APX GIS programme.

## **Prerequisites**
1.	**User ID** and **Password** to access APX-GIS programme.

------------

**Version**: 5.3
**Date**: May-2025

## **Introduction**

In modern applications, secure and seamless authentication is critical for both user experience and security. APX is integrated a Single Sign-On (SSO) system using OpenID Connect (OIDC), a modern authentication protocol built on OAuth 2.0.

The SSO system enables users to authenticate once and gain access to APX. By leveraging OpenID Connect, we ensure robust identity verification and integration with identity providers like Google, Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) and others.

The option to not use SSO is also available by creating the credentials in APX

**Note**: The authentication method is exclusive, meaning that users created via SSO cannot enter using the regular Sign-in.

## **Step by Step**
