Fill up at least the "**Code**" field to be able to identify and  reference this NOI in the future. The "**description**" field is free text to give aditional information and it is optional.
Then select the Roles that should be able to see this NOI. The rest of the fields are autopopulated and hence Read-only.

To add elements to the NOI there are two possible methods.

1. To select elements straight from the map click the "**Select from Map**" button.
