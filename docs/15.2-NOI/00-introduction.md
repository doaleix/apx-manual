APX delivers robust lifecycle management for the Notice of Intent (NOI) process, integrating seamlessly with OpenReach (OR) to enhance PIA element tracking, usage reporting, and evidence submission. This comprehensive feature empowers users to maintain accurate records, ensure compliance, and boost operational efficiency.

NOIs in APX follow a structured lifecycle from creation to completion or abandonment, encompassing:

1. **NOI Creation and Initialization**: Users can initiate new NOIs directly within APX. Once opened with OpenReach, a unique PIA NOI number is automatically retrieved and recorded, providing seamless synchronisation between systems.
2. **Element Management, Usage Reporting, and Evidence Capture**: NOIs facilitate detailed reporting on associated PIA elements, including intended usage. Users can capture evidence for diverse scenarios along the route and report blockages when encountered.
3. **Status Tracking and Notifications**: APX monitors each NOIâ€™s status. NOIs are valid for 12 months, with up to two 2-month extensions (overall 4 additional months). Automated notifications alert users as expiration approaches, helping prevent lapses in management.
4. **Extension Management**: Users can request extensions within APX, ensuring flexibility while maintaining regulatory compliance.
5. **Access Control and Reporting**: Only authorised roles can access and manage NOIs, with advanced filtering by status and code. Integration with SED enhances periodic progress reporting.
6. **Completion and Compliance**: NOIs can only be marked completed when all required evidence fields are properly submitted to OpenReach. Missing evidence prevents completion.
