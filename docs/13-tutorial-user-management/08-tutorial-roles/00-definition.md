## Roles


Users can have one or more roles and each of those have a set of privileges that can be enabled (true), disabled (false) or undefined. Roles are assigned to users, forming a hierarchy that enables users to perform specific activities.

### Standard APX-GIS Roles

- **Administrator**: Has full configuration access, including the entire administration menu (Roles, Element types, Imports), as well as planner and operator tasks.
- **Planner**: Can create and manage projects, define element types, and configure planning details.
- **Operator**: Executes tasks within the defined workflows and performs field data collection.
