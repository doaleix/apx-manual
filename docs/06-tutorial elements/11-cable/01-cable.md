## **Fiber tab**

In this tab, you can find all the fibers of the cable, along with information about whether each one is connected or not, and to which port or fiber it is connected at its origin and at its destination. It also indicates if the fiber belongs to a P2P service as a selected fiber, using the service name.

When a fiber is connected at either the origin or the destination, you can click on the corresponding table cell, which opens a dialog with additional details about that connection. The dialog shows the color pattern of the cable and, depending on whether it is connected to a port or to another fiber, different information is displayed.

When the three dots of a given fiber is clicked, it opens a popup displaying various additional options available in this tab. You can access the Element Route Details component directly from this menu, in addition to the origin and destination interconnection information of the fiber.
