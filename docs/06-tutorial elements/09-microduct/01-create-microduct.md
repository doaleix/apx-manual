4\. **Important:** Microducts are always created inside **Ducts**. the best practice is to create (1) Duct then (2) Subducts and last (3) Microducts.

You need to identify the **Duct** and **Subduct** to which the **Microduct** will be assigned.

Look for the **Duct** element and click it. For this example, the duct was located directly from the map and clicked.

Another way to look for an element is using the search bar. (Please refer to: "**Search &gt; Open element from search results (All layers))**" from this training material.
