# Tutorial Introduction

The content of this material responds to a standard APXGIS configuration. It will have the default element types and there may be variants that respond to the adaptations that are made of the system to the client's requirements.

Each section has the following documents:
- **Definition:** brief explanation of the concept through an infographic.
- **Step by step:** Document that contains the details of each of the steps to follow to perform the task in APXGIS.
In the Prerequisites section of this document it is indicated which roles can carry out the task to be described.
The following roles are considered:
1. **Administrator:** Can do configuration tasks, have access to the whole administration menu (Roles, Element types, imports), as well as planner and operator tasks.
2. **Planner:** Can create projects and assign elements to the different projects.
3. **Operator:** by assigning one or more projects, this role can add or modify elements to the assigned projects.


## Starting Point
APX-GIS is a data asset recording software launched by APFutura, which can show the layout of physical inventory of an optical fiber network in a map with several types of views.
APX-GIS is a cloud-based system and records data in real-time once changes are applied. Users can log on from both computer and mobile devices (Android or iOS smartphones and tablets).

APX GIS is an outside plant management tool that allows the geo-reference of the following elements:

- British Telecomunications (BT) Physical Infrastructure (Black Duct, poles and chambers)
- Physical Infrastructure (Tube Distribution Closure locations and Subduct routing)
- Cabinets
- Joint boxes
- Fiber Patches (FPs)
- Splitters
- Cable locations/routes
- Fibre splicing
- Schematics
## Advantages of using APX GIS

APX GIS allows **Planners**:

- to have all the information available for their processes of planning, built and monitor optical fiber network deployments.
- to view network layouts and generate reports about optical fiber network projects, routes and UPRNs coverage status.
- to optimize activation and fault management processes of fibre optical networks.

APX GIS allows field **Technicians**:

- to manage existing and new optical fiber networks based on existing physical infrastructure.
- to manage activation and maintenance services.
