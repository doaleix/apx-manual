# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **APX GIS** programme.

# Definition

Get started with **APX GIS** programme.

### Starting Point
APX-GIS is a data asset recording software launched by APFutura, which can show the layout of physical inventory of an optical fiber network in a map with several types of views.  
APX-GIS is a cloud-based system and records data in real-time once changes are applied. Users can log on from both computer and mobile devices (Android or iOS smartphones and tablets).

## Advantages of using APX GIS

APX GIS allows planners:

- to have all the information available for their processes of planning, built and monitor optical fiber network deployments.
- to view network layouts and generate reports about optical fiber network projects, routes and UPRNs coverage status.
- to optimize activation and fault management processes of fibre optical networks.

APX GIS allows field technicians:

- to manage existing and new optical fiber networks based on existing physical infrastructure.
- to manage activation and maintenance services.
